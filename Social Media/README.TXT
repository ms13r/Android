Social media project. This project will store users in an online Firebase Database based
on their Facebook IDs, as well as their ten most recent likes. Using this, we allow for 
friends of the user (who also use the app -- change due to Facebook 2.0 API) to select them, 
and look through their 10 most recent likes and choose a retailer to purchase a gift at.
Web searches modified due to API changes of websites as well as restriction of credentials.

Project done by Paul Nieto, Austin Casale, Philip Wiezorek, Jordan Baker, and myself.
