The following project utilizes internal Android sensors such as flashlight and vibration, 
and provides a chat client between paired individuals on the same WiFi network. It pairs
two devices, and upon both users agreeing to pair with each other, it allows for interactions
and "sabotaging" the individual that the user is paired with. This includes altering screen
brightness, adjusting user volume, and causing the other user's phone to vibrate.

The project was a collaborative effort between Benjamin Clark, Austin Casale, Philip Wiezorek,
and myself.
